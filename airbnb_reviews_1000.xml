</title>
</document>
<document id="83">
<title>
Lois and Paul were amazing hosts We arrived to find homemade bread Loiss special Friendship Cake and eggs for breakfast from their own hens It felt like a country retreat but it was a leisurely walk or a quick cab journey into Central Bristol The house was comfortable and beautifully designed with a full kitchen Well definitely book here again
</title>
</document>
<document id="84">
<title>
What a lovely place to stay Lois and Paul were the perfect hosts and both the eco house and its setting are beautiful and all the more amazing for being in the middle of busy Bristol It really is an oasis Inside was warm homely and welcoming with stacks of room to spread ourselves about and a fridge and cupboards heaving with complimentary goodies We felt very spoiled Why on earth do people use hotels Sadly I was unwell whilst we were away but the house felt enough like home that it wasnt as ghastly as it might have been and the woodburner was a godsend Well absolutely be back Highly recommended
</title>
</document>
<document id="85">
<title>
Lovely place just a short bus ride from the city  Very welcoming hosts and a warm cosy place to stay  Recommended
</title>
</document>
<document id="86">
<title>
Our family of five stayed at the eco house for two nights in Feb 2013 and we were delighted with the experience  The house has a warm feel and with the loft area has plenty of room  In its location it is a convenient bus or taxi ride from most areas of the city yet has a distinct country feel  We would come again and recommend to other families
</title>
</document>
<document id="87">
<title>
Had a blast with Lois and Paul Wanted to stay somewhere other than a hotel and this place is magic  our own little home not far from the city centre with open fire and magnificent hosts made it a pleasurable experience Looking forward to coming back for some more red wine and music
</title>
</document>
<document id="88">
<title>
This is a great place to stay being well appointed comfortable and close to local facilities Lois and Paul are welcoming and helpful and care about their guests I would highly recommend the ecohouse as a good choice
</title>

<document id="89">
<title>
Lois and Paul made us feel very welcome The house was lovely and cosy despite the bitter weather outside We had a delicious breakfast on Sunday morning thanks to the provisions left for us by Lois  the plum jam was amazing Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again the next time we visit Bristol
</title>
</document>
<document id="90">
<title>
This is a great place to stay I can only agree with previous reviewers in their praise of the warm welcome given by Lois and Paul The house is original and thoughtfully designed  a pleasure to stay in and warm in spite of the bitter temperatures The location of the house is wonderful  you feel as if youre in the country while being in the middle of town It is quiet and peaceful for sleeping and close to good restaurants if you want to eat out The fresh eggs generously provided by Lois and Paul made excellent breakfasts We would love to stay there again if the occasion arose
</title>
</document>
<document id="91">
<title>
We had a fanstastic time in the Eco house Lois and Paul were great hosts and really went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable even finding old toys for our children to play with The house had everything we needed and was very warm even through the coldest March in 50 years The two main bedrooms were large our two girls comfortably shared a bedroom the kitchen was well equipped there were two bathrooms and lots of space for us all The best part for us was the space outside for the children to play in both on the property and in the community park just outside the gate It was just perfect for travelling with kids There was a bus stop just 5 minutes walk away with a really good service and Whiteladies Road was only a 10 minute walk It was a real home away from home for us and I cant recommend it highly enough We would definitely stay here again
</title>
</document>
<document id="92">
<title>
The house is lovely and in an excellent location Lois kindly provided us with homemade bread eggs from their hens and bacon and tomatoes so that was Saturday mornings full English sorted We had a great break and would recommend the house without any hesitation

This is the most wonderful place to stay in Bristol You are surrounded by parkland yet in the middle of the city Lois and Paul are the most wonderful hosts  they have lots of great ideas about things to do in and outside Bristol They were absolutely wonderful with our children I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay and would stay here again if we returned to Bristol

We had the most wonderful time at the Eco house Lois and Paul are the most wonderful hosts  they made our time there so very special It is in a wonderful location surrounded by park land and allotments  also an easy walk to the city or by bus Most definitely would recommend this as a place to stay we hope to come back one day Gerard and Jane and our children Atticus and Elliot

We had a wonderful stay with the most hospitable Lois and Paul making us feel very welcome

<title>
This was a fun place to hang out close to the city centre  Its a much better option for a family than a hotel or BB as the kids have tons of space to run around  Lois and Paul are great hosts  The house is slightly smaller than it looks in the photos but the grounds are big and spacious  We loved it
</title>

<document id="97">
<title>
 We booked the Ecco house for one night but were moved to the barn next to the Ecco house because the host had another family who booked both sides of the date we booked for so we agreed to let them have the uninterrupted stay  We should not have agreed on that because the rooms at the barn are in very bad condition  Rooms very small and the beds are not comfortable plus there is no hot water   Though the hosts are very nice people we still wont give any credit to the rooms  They are filthy and not worth even 12 of the price we paid

Since our first email contact Lois was really kind and helpful providing all the advices we needed before travelling That included a detailed guide of how to get to their amazing house in the middle of the park but incredibly close to both the city centre and Kings Camps venue at Bristol and also well connected by bus that the taxi driver thanked a lot Lois and Paul gave us a very warm welcome even though we arrived a bit late The house is very comfortable and fully equipped and our three kids 8 5 3 years old found here surprises in every corner of the house They have also enjoyed a lot the park and the playground area next to the house She prepares great bread and a superb fruit cake that together with the eggs of their hens bacon fruit and milk they provided us made a great and much appreciated beginning of our stay at the ecohouse Paul and Lois did every day their best to make us feel at home and they have been great tourist guides Its been wonderful to meet them These two weeks in their house have fulfilled the high expectations we had from airbnb

After a longer than anticipated journey we followed Loiss helpfully detailed directions to the house and found everything prepared for us including homemade bread and cake etc Lois came to greet us shortly after our arrival and made sure that we knew how everything worked and helped us to get our bearings in the neighbourhoodOur granddaughters had been looking forward to seeing the house and their expectations were more than met We spent our first evening settling in and making ourselves at home and had a great nights sleep as the property is so quiet and maintains a comfortable and constant temperatureIn the morning we found the lovely garden and outside areas In the evening we walked up into the park in which the property is situated with the play area which the girls enjoyed Our ages ranged from 71 to 13 and we were all happy and comfortable partly because there are many interesting spaces in the house to be together in or to escape to Being allowed to play the grand piano was a delight for our eldest granddaughter and demonstrates the generosity of the host family All ages of children would enjoy the house there are games toys and books and much to explore We particularly enjoyed the great variety of art work in all of the rooms the wire sculptures and the ceramics It is a rare privilege to stay in a house which has been so imaginatively embellishedWe already knew Bristol but the guide books and all of the information left for visitors was really helpful and provided interesting reading in the evenings The kitchen is wonderfully wellequipped and all appliances easy to use which made catering easy There is plenty of information about restaurants and cafes nearby We had one query about working the television which we felt perfectly at ease to ask Lois about and was explained It was clear that our enjoyment was important to our host and we felt really welcomed and comfortableNone of us had stayed in a house like the ecohouse before it really is special Traditionally our annual holidays with our granddaughters have been spent in ancient Landmark trust properties so it was a unique experience for us and one that we would all like to experience again The time went all too quickly and none of us wanted to leave for home
</title>
</document>
<document id="219">
<title>
Lois was a wonderful host providing home made bread and cakes and went out of her way to make us feel most welcomeThe accommodation was exactly what we required and was a perfect base for preparing our daughter the Bride and 6 bridesmaids to go off to her special day at Redland Parish church 200 yards away across the parkThe house is tucked away behind double gates in the park secure and relaxing and you would not know you were in a large city we will never forget our stay because of its special significance and we could not of wished for a more perfect host or accommodationWe hope to stay again as it is a little oasis in a busy city

Although shes a retired dentist Lois has obviously channeled a previous life as a very competent innkeeper The eco house is an extremely comfortable exquisitely located property that we were happy to call home for the first week of September Other reviewers have used the term peaceful urban oasis which is an apt description I suggest you take the time to visit the peaceful gardens should the weather permit this is England after all and notice some of the outdoor and indoor sculpture and artLois has the house well and thoughtfully provisioned we were delighted with the breakfast goodies bacon eggs butter milk etc etc left in the fridge and the truly delicious home baked coffee cake and bread A glance at eco houses guest book reveals a virtual united nations of guest home addressesLois and husband Paul are kind and considerate hosts and we were made to feel very much at home If you need a cuddle  Mittens the propertys incredibly sweet and blind watch cat is the sweetest friendliest love machine youll meet on your trip

Lois and Paul made us feel very welcome as soon as I and my three girlfriends arrived The Ecohouse is in a wonderful location The walk into the city centre is a tad long but manageable there are buses The highlight of our stay was the use of the delightful greenhouse pool with its amazing tropical plants including pineapples As Lois was away during our stay her house sitter Chris continued the thoughtful hospitality  providing assistance when required flat car battery The beds are comfy and clean The kitchen is well equipped and provisioned We do hope that Lois will run round with a feather duster from time to time to remove the countless cobwebs and hanging spiders Other than that it was a very enjoyable stay in a unique home

This is a quirky and unusual house with generous and equally unique hosts They made us so very welcome and nothing was too much trouble The house is in Redland Park which is unusual but makes it safe for family Come here with a car or good legs The hills are steep The house is surrounded by trees and wildlife with a play park outside the house gate There are Toys and space near the house to play  We used their travel cot and high chair and there is a stair gate available for our grandson We gathered here with adult children and partners plus a baby Lots of space although the boys upstairs found it hot during a warm spell Car parking is right at the door behind a secluded and locked gate Finding it was easy with instructionsThis place is great for a laid back family It isnt five star living and the beds are Ikea and a little unstable I have a terrible back but was ok I found the heat in such an insulated house to be difficult although when he heat broke it got better There is a fan but I would bring one if I came again And we would come again My son lives in Clifton and we found this a lovely place to spend time with him his partner and other family who travelled from Scotland

The location of this house could not have been better especially for families It is super quiet at night has a lovely parkplayground right outside the gate and is walkable to lots of businesses including a few grocery stories and a fishmonger We also walked down to the center several times and both train stations Redlands and Temple Meads The house is full of toys and books for kids had a well equipped kitchen all the makings for our first breakfast and some homemade jam and bread Tons of space for two couples and a kid to spread out with the lofts upstairs Two notes the mattresses are quite firm Im told this is typical for England and the back bathroom is a wet room with no shower enclosure Neither would dissuade us from staying againwe likely will next time were in Bristol

Richard and Ray were fantastic hosts Super flexible and really welcoming we felt from the start more at a good friends house rather than in a BB We had a wonderful time and joined them in learning more about fantastic Bristols night life The room was spacious comfy and brand new with access to a bathroom just for us The flat is located really close to the Railway station and really few minutes walk to the centre Bristol if you are unconvinced is definitely worth a good weekend at least We were extra lucky as the  Harbour Festival was on and it was great Thank you very much we cant wait to come back

<title>
Definitely fantastic hosts  They travelled a lot so they know how it is to stay at someones house They are very friendly and helpful without being intrusive Everything is clean and thats a real plus  Theres everything you need in the bathroom  bathgel toothpaste towel better than a hotel  That flat is really near 2 commercialcenters and you can easy go from there by walk to the other side of the city Dont worry about wifi  it just works everywhere in the flat and fast If you want to stay near the citycenter I hardly recommend you this address

This was very clean quiet and pretty central with a useful 24 hour shop nearby Richard and his mum went to a lot of trouble to bring me a hair dryer late at night when I needed it the next morning And no foam pillowsThe only thing that slightly lets it down was rather smelly and squalid common parts with scattered pizza menus and other rubbish But once past them very nice Thank you

Natashas house is amazing and I have to say that the whole family are quite nice Natasha and her husband are always providing useful advice for me not only of living in Bristol but also UK range Actually her husband Ed hosted me for most of the time and he was being a fabulous host all the time This green room I lived in is brilliant perfectly matched its description By the way the kitchen is my favourite part of the house modern fully fitted and of course quite big and theres nice breakfast they have offered All I wanna say is that I enjoyed my cooking time here In addition they have a nice shower I highly recommend the Green Room here totally worth the money

<document id="637">
<title>
I checked in late after 930pm on the day of my arrival but Ed stayed up and nicely waited for me I met Natasha and the children on the following morning and was pleased by the homely laid back atmosphere but also by the little details that showed that the hosts indeed cared for their guests For example the book shelf in my bedroom had a small collection of selected publications from and about different corners of the world reflecting probably Natashas own interests and making feel the guest immediately welcome Also on the shelf there was a choice of shampoo conditioner soap bar and bath salts of very good quality The breakfast was golden standard the one I had on Sat morning with home made pancakes was amazingThe neighbourhood is quiet day and night Its a 30minute walk to the university campus Overall a very good experience

It was great as expected Nice and friendly family and a very nice room too Plenty of small lovely details such as flowers and shower gel etc in the room Breakfast was delicious Highly recommended for people who loves children and dogs and are not bothered wake up early in the morning as the 3 year old can be sometimes a bit loud But we didnt mind at all we would do it again for sure There were some jobs being done in the garden and therefore the house was a bit messy sometimes Natasha and Ed kept apologising the whole time and they were trying to make us feel as much comfortable as they could The flat is located in a very quiet zone not a long distance walking to the centre Thanks Natasha and Ed

Lovely little room in a very cool little neighbourhood Amazing backyard that I got to enjoy in the rare British sunshine with the loveliest dog Freddie Walking distance to the stokes croft and Gloucester road areas Ed and Natasha are the most gracious hosts I could have hoped for even inviting me to have dinner with them and their two lovely children one evening I stayed in Could not have asked for a better weekend

From preinformation to when we left we had a really great experience  It kicked off with a totally unexpected barbecue which was an amazing array of delicious veggies and top quality meats  Most welcome after a 4 hour drive  The room itself was compact but very quiet and comfortable with really nice bed linen towels and complimentary toiletriesThe area is is really lovely with an almost village feel to it  Nice coffee at the pizza place on the corner convenience stores and an internet cafe the wifi in the house is great but I needed a load of printing done  Im sure I could have asked Ed but he was out with the kidsNatasha was away that weekend but we were hosted by her partner Ed and two of the sweetest kids  We were made to feel so welcome and at home  Will definitely stay again if we need to get up to Bristol again

<title>
Ed was very friendly helpful and welcoming  The room and house were lovely and clean with a nice homely feel  I liked that here was a TV in the room along with books and other amenities  I felt very comfortable there and liked that I could have my own privacy but at the same time could interact with my host  There are several shops and cafes as well as a park one minute from the house  St Werburghs is a great area to visit I d definitely like to stay at Natasha and Eds again
</title>

Whilst I couldnt attend my booking due to other commitments cropping up at the last second I would still thoroughly recommend Natasha as a host She was extremely kind and accommodating at all stages responding to queries very quickly and helpfully If the room is as good as the service which Im sure it is then you cant go wrong with Natasha

My partner and I really enjoyed our stay at The Green Room  Natasha was away but we were made very welcome by Ed the children and their gorgeous dog who could sway even a non dog lover Im sure It was lovely to be in such a friendly environment  Our room was peaceful with comfy bed high quality bed linen and good storage The electric blanket made it very snuggly during a cold snap  St Werbughs is great for walking into town and has lots of character and green enclaves  recommend a trip to the city farm  Excellent info provided in our room about eating out and so on   Super clean bathroom with luxurious underfloor heating  Would highly recommend a stay here  
</title>
</document>
<document id="698">
<title>
This is the second time Ive stayed with Natasha and Ed and just like the first it was wonderful They are such fantastic hosts and I felt so at home I have just booked my next trip back and cant wait to see them all again 
</title>
</document>
<document id="699">
<title>
Previous reviews had been good so we thought we were in safe hands but it did not live up to them at all The room itself is very tiny indeed with a smaller than average double bed which made sleeping for two uncomfortable as the bed was pushed up against the cold outside wallwindow The room smelled of damp and evidence of a damp wall could be seen above the wardrobe where the paint had bubbled The bathroom is modern and clean but the bath is very short Hospitalitywise we did not feel particularly welcome to use the kitchen and no breakfast was forthcoming or even an evening or early morning cup of tea as there was no milk available The area itself is run down compared to other parts of Bristol and as a single person I would not feel comfortable walking the streets at night in this neighbourhood 
</title>
</document>
<document id="700">
<title>
This was my first time using Airbnb and we had a lovely stay The house was nice and Ed made us feel very welcome and at home and gave us all the assistance we needed and even sent texts to ask if we were ok which was nice We only stayed for 1 night but we both wanted to stay longer We also had an electric blanket incase it got to cold Would defiantly recommend 
</title>
</document>
<document id="701">

Our night was very good We were a little bit frightened but when Ed opened the door everything started to be perfect He was very nice with us all the time He make us feel like at home and like if we are friends so that was really good I think that you have to feel good energy to be comfortable and he and his family did it We are very grateful Thank you for everythingBest regards

<title>
We agreed with the hostess Natasha that we would come at 9pm As Natasha was planning to leave for the weekend we were supposed to meet her husband We came at 9pm but nobody opened the door The host did not answer any of our calls Fortunately it was possible to contact Natasha She was trying to contact her husband but then just asked a friend to come with the keys and let us inside We finally managed to come in only after about 15 hours of waiting outside We were very tired and went to sleep immediately At midnight the owner returned with his children and raised such a noise that it was impossible to sleep The room matches the description the only negative is a very uncomfortable mattress To be honest Im surprised that this room has so many positive feedbacks as our stay there thankfully short was terrible Perhaps we were just unlucky
</title>

<title>
Natasha Ed their kids  Isi and Ben  made my stay unforgettable Ive used Airbnb regularly for the past 3 years  this is one of the best experiences  from beginning to end The family welcomed me warmly and at the same time give me space when I needed Nastasha and Ed are both really interesting people The kids are charming  and funny  The room has a superbly calm and peaceful vibe The garden is the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance I spent a bit of time exploring the neighbourhood which has ecohousing community city farm great organic supermarket  cafe and lots of walking trails Hope to see them again next time when Im in Bristol

We had a fabulous 2 night stay at Ed and Natashas Airbnb in Bristol  I only booked the day before and we walked into a very clean sweet room and house  Their area in St Werberghs is very very diverse full of life and fun  The city was an easy 15 minute walk along the lake We had a car and drove to Bath 30 minutes and the train from the city takes 10 minutes  Ed and  Natasha were warm and friendly people and we felt very relaxed staying at their home  The bed was very comfy There is heaps of information for guests about Bristol and beyond including info re restaurants cafes and pubs  Have a pint at their local pub The Duke of York its worth it   I loved Natashas advice  St Werberghs is a bit grungy with a heart It was our kind of town  Thanks heaps to both Ed and Natasha and their sweet kids for welcoming us so kindly  They have a beautiful dog named Freddy  and she is divine and welcomed us warmly as well  Highly recommend to those who like being in a family home in a multicultural area with all the pleasures that it brings  Brenda and Damian

Great location in an emerging and modern neighbourhood with the City Farm a small shop and great restaurants nearby and an Ikea Tesco and Boots within a 10minutes walk The bedroom comes with towels a fan and an electric blanket The location is perfect A 7minute bus ride to the city centre bus stop located 2 minutes from the house or a 35minute walk The house has lived in which made me really comfortable as it reminded me of my own house but does not look much like the pictures anymoreMy arrival was perfect with Natasha offering me a cup of tea and dinner avocados and eggs Even though Natasha and I initially had some misunderstandings about the use of the kitchen during my stay she works at home and Im used to cook at lunchtime but she had her fabrics out and the smell of cooking could ruin them we eventually worked them out and even discovered we had common interests Ed was amazing offering emotional support during my time away from home and doing anything he could so I could get a strong wifi signal in my bedroom although this issue was not 100 fixed They were both extremely kind when I took ill for a week and I had to stay home offering me cake and making sure I stayed hydrated The kids are friendly and I really enjoyed spending time with them However they also know about personal boundaries and they will not disturb you at any time As most kids do they wake up really early and full of energy and drama Last but not least Freddie the dog is the most beautiful loving and adorable pet I have met and she helped me get through my trip away from from home I was even allowed to take her out to a nearby park to play goandfetch which made me really happyEven though the family is going through a difficultcomplex situation they were polite to each other and never got me involved They also have people over very often and they had no problems introducing me to their friends and even offering me to join their gatherings to eat cake and a barbecue All of their friends were extremely kind and they made an effort to get to know me which I really appreciated On my last day there Natasha very kindly offered to drive me to the train station and Ed asked me to text them when I got to my destination safe and sound In short A real family with a perfectly located room in a livedin house with limited kitchen use during the day and an amazing dog to keep you company

We were greeted by Ed who was very friendly and helpful As we were using the BB as a base whilst we were working full time we didnt spend too much time there during the day however it is worth noting that it is a family home and at times can be quite noisy and chaotic Other than that the house was nice and Natasha was very good with communicating Ps Freddie the dog was very friendly

everything in caths place was confortable available and we felt perfectly at home we also received some useful information aboutthe neighbourhood Im very satisfied about my experience
</title>

<document id="846">
<title>
Cath looked after my parents beautifully when I could not accomodate them in my house just down the road from Caths It turned out to be a really good solution with my parents being able to go get a good nights sleep and breakfast in the lovely victorian house with massive garden and then wander to ours to hang out with their grandchild Cath was a very helpful host and I have already recommended her to other friends
</title>
</document>
<document id="847">
<title>
Cath and Patrick were very flexible and helpful hosts  They had holiday plans of their own around the same time but accommodated all our needs  Their home is very comfortable with a spacious room for guests  They were friendly but gave us our own space too  The home is conveniently located and we would definitely recommend their bnb to others
</title>
</document>
<document id="848">
<title>
No particular action was taken to make us feel welcome only that we should not expect the same as in a normal B  B no English breakfast etcWe felt uncomfortable because we had to share the bathroom and toilet with the family and other guests a little too crowded in a small house good perhaps for students but not for a mature couple very different from a regular B  B indeed There was no toiletpaper in the bathroom the first morning no where to be foundThe room was big enough but cluttered with a big curtain and all sort of things stuck on top with an unpleasant smell coming from that cornerNo television in the room decent Wifi thoughThe walking distance to the city was correct about ten minutes walkingIt would have been nice to have some more information in the room about  where to eat where to shop etc  The hostess seemed very pressed busy etc etc
</title>
</document>
<document id="849">
<title>
We enjoyed excellent communication from Cath prior to our stay and were made to feel most welcome on arrival The house was lovely and our room was spacious with a most comfortable bed The other facilities bathroom and kitchen were very homely and well appointed The house is well situated for the centre of Bristol and only a short walk gets you to to the heart of the city

I only stayed for one night arriving late and leaving early but the hosts are very welcoming The house is beautiful and the bed very cosy It would have been nice to have more time in Bristol and Im sure I would have been more than satisfied with this placeNo downside that I could see Would only recommend to light sleepers that they bring ear plugs Loud regular chimes from the clock

I stayed with Cath for a couple of nights while working in Bristol I was made very welcome on arrival shown around and left to get on with my ironing  My stay was comfortable and peaceful  I think I slept better there than at home which is unusualThe location is ideal for central Bristol but off a side street so quiet and Cath was a lovely host

1 Re Airbnb this was my first booking with Airbnb and I was shocked to learn how Airbnb robs people who book rooms through their website When I was checking the prices the Airbnb service fee was 6 and as I proceeded to booking the service fee suddenly went up to 7 Absolutely shocking and this business just proved how unprofessional the Airbnb is   I am absolutely disappointed about Airbnb and Id rather pay 100 more and book a descent hotel which does not treat its customers like idiots This is an insult to common sense   2 Re Caths roomCaths room was a wonderful room and the bed was absolutely comfortable Cath and her husband were very nice people and the house in general was very quiet Parking can be risky as there is no reserved parking and parking is on street parking We were lucky because one car just moved away as we approached leaving us a space otherwise we would have left with nowhere to park

<title>
The double room was more than I needed for my very brief stay Clean tidy and a comfy bed My ironing needs were met as soon as I rolled in Breakfast options laid out were a nice touch If only Id had time to sit and indulge that more Many thanks

Cath and Patrick Slade picked up our luggage from Bristol Temple Meads station so that we could continue our train journey on time very thoughtful of them The beds and the breakfast was very good we slept like a log We had a little bad luck with a broken door key and hot water boiler with errors but that did not spoil the fun we had  Cath and Patrick reacted flexible and caring towards us and tackled the issues right away  On sunday we had a nice warm fire in the living room and a little home made apple cider They helped us with a taxi to airport and gave us nice places to see in cityOn the day of our departure the got up although it was very early to say goodbye So Cath and Patrick are very interested in their guests and helpful were they can Their house is very tidy and the place breaths English culture every ware
