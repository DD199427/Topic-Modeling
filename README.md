# Topic-Modeling

Airbnb reviews were extracted, for the reason of familiarity only the reviews in English were retained for our use. These were lemmatised, tokenised etc so as to be made 
usable for our Topic Modelling. Then we can see that these reviews were modelled according to LDA and LSA algorithms for dtermining the jest of the topic structures. LDA was better as it was Graphical and easier to interpret. Then these reviews were converted to XMLK format so that they can be experimented on with Carrot Workbench, which gave the best possible results.
